This mobile application is intended as a gift to my mother for Mother's Day 2024. I created this mobile application to eliminate the need to record a grocery list on paper. 
Eliminating the need for paper will do several things:
    Not requiring a physical document for shopping list
    Easily modifiable list of grocery items
    Available to you at all times (as long as you have your phone)

This mobile app does not use user authentication, storing data locally on the users phone. In later iterations of the app, authentication with Google and email/password will be added.
For now, no authentication is done to make the application easy to use.
